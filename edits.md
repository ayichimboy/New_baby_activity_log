## Introduction
Understanding a baby's daily patterns can help caregivers provide better care. This project examines data on feeding times, sleep durations, and diaper changes to identify trends and correlations.

## Data Description
The dataset includes:
- **Feeding:** Timestamp and amount (oz)
- **Sleeping:** Start and end times
- **Diaper Changes:** Timestamp and type (wet, dirty, both)

## Analysis Overview
The analysis covers:
- **Feeding Patterns:** Frequency and quantity
- **Sleep Analysis:** Total sleep time and sleep intervals
- **Diaper Changes:** Frequency and type distribution
- **Correlation Analysis:** Relationships between feeding, sleeping, and diaper changes

## Visualizations
Key visualizations include:
- **Time Series Plots:** Feeding and sleeping over time
- **Histograms:** Distribution of feeding amounts and sleep durations
- **Heatmaps:** Correlations between different activities

## Conclusions
The analysis reveals:
- **Feeding:** Peak times and average consumption
- **Sleeping:** Average sleep duration and patterns
- **Diaper Changes:** Common times and types
- **Correlations:** Insights into how activities influence each other
